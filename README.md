persistent-chunked
==================

This package provides support for streaming queries that return chunked sources. This is often desirable when iterating
over large datasets or doing batch updates on a big table. If you are using the MySQL backend, also take a look at the
persistent-mysql-extra package which provides several MySQL-specific batch queries.

Contributions welcome!
